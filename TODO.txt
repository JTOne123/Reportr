High Priority
-------------

- Create DataSource and Query implementations in:
	- Data.Sql
	- Data.Csv
	- Data.Json
	- Data.Xml

- Create way of 'registering' and managing IQuery etc implementations so project can use with IoC containers

- Put report categories and "registered" reports (with name, description and definition generator/source (e.g. RDL language or customer class that generates repot defintion bny loading all data sources, querise etc and compiling the componets together)) into seperate project such as Reportr.Registration
	- With the above, we could have a customer EF version such as Reportr.Registration.Entity that has a custom DbContext with saveable entities, so there is no need to code this into the project that uses Reportr
	- This could also contain security such as registered roles and assigning reports to roles and also assinging report parameters to roles with default values

Security
--------

- Reports for certain types of user (roles)

- Locked/defaulted filter parameters/values based on role?


Templates
---------

- How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

- Template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)


Rendering
---------

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority
------------

- Create 'Infrastructure' project that manages storage and retrieval of categories

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
