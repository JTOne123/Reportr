Unsorted
--------

- Implement IRegisteredReportDefinitionBuilder and register in RegistrationTypeRegister
	- Ensure we have a way of getting all registered IReportDefinitionBuilder types
	- How do we instantiate report builder from type name? Dependency injection?

- RegisteredReportGenerator.SetParameterConstraints
	- How do we force parameter values to be hidden in report filter when we apply constraint?
	
- Complete RegisteredReportGenerator.ConvertParameterValue

- A report generator facade that hides the idea of report definition and auto authenticates user
	- Also need a facade for report filters so that we can generate filter with defaulted values (based on role assignment constraints) and set a flag to disable/hide them - then enforce these rules upon report generation

- Do we need to log every report generation request and result?


High Priority
-------------

- Create DataSource and Query implementations in:
	- Data.Csv
	- Data.Json
	- Data.Xml


Security
--------

- Reports for certain types of user (roles)

- Locked/defaulted filter parameters/values based on role?


Templates
---------

- How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

- Template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)


Rendering
---------

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority
------------

- Optimize report generation by caching query results where the query and parameter values are identical (then we can reuse the same data multiple times)

- Create 'Infrastructure' project that manages storage and retrieval of categories

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
