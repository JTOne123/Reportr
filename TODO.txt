Unsorted

- Report filter parameter lookup data source (e.g. list of organisations or dealers instead of having to type key manually)
	- How do we pass user meta data into lookup filters so we can filter the auto data down? (e.g. user belongs to organisation and has a constraint, so we must filter lookup items for organisation to just the one the user is in).

- How do we auto unregister reports, roles, categories, category and role assignments?

- Create ability to log all registered report generations with their data so we can keep an audit trail for security reasons. E.g. report to show customer information, gets leaked. Logs can be checked to see who generated that data and when so it can be traced.


High Priority
-------------

- Look into schema mapping issue for Entity Framework in EfDataSource
	https://github.com/schneidenbach/EntityFramework.Metadata/blob/master/src/EntityFramework.Metadata/Mappers/MapperBase.cs#L479

- Create DataSource and Query implementations in:
	- Data.Csv
	- Data.Json
	- Data.Xml


Templates
---------

- How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

- Template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)


Rendering
---------

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority
------------

- Optimize report generation by caching query results where the query and parameter values are identical (then we can reuse the same data multiple times)

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Find a more generic way around using JsonObjectAttribute and JsonIgnoreAttribute for serializing using JSON.NET

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
