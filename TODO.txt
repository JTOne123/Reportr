** Rename ReportOutput to Report and refactor to match what bit should be

*** Security:
	- Reports for certain type of user (roles)
	- Locked filter values based on role?

** What about some sort of Report Definition Language (RDL)?
	- Like "define report "Name" with components [x, y, z] in section n"
	- Simular to JSON syntax?
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/reports/report-definition-language-ssrs?view=sql-server-2017
	- https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/features/r-services/ssms-custom-reports

*** How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

*** Component optional relative width and height (%)
	- And margin (top/left/right/bottom width and unit)
*** Report template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)
*** How do we calculate actual height of section so we can paginate?
*** Binding of query result to component structure which allows template to auto generate
	- For repeater, if no binding specified them entire result is the value given
	- Can we add an IsDefined function to Nettle so we can see if property exists?

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority:
-------------

- Integrate with Nettle

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Create report builder with storage mechanism

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
