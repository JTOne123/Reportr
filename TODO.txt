High Priority
-------------

- Report component margin (top/left/right/bottom width and unit)


Security
--------

- Reports for certain types of user (roles)

- Locked/defaulted filter parameters/values based on role?


Templates
---------

- How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

- Template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)

- Integrate with Nettle
	- Can we add an IsDefined(path) function to Nettle so we can see if path exists?

Rendering
---------

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority
------------

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Create report builder with storage mechanism

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
