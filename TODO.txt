Unsorted
--------

- Need some sort of optional user info structure to check if they have permission.
	- Include user meta data (key-value pair) so we can haven things like dealer key etc that can be used to override filter parameter values

- Need to be able to default and disable report filter parameters based on user role (and associated meta data? E.g. user organisation key etc).

- A report generator facade that hides the idea of report definition and auto authenticates user.

- How do we instantiate report builder from type name? Dependency injection?

- Do we need to log every report generation request and result?


High Priority
-------------

- Create DataSource and Query implementations in:
	- Data.Csv
	- Data.Json
	- Data.Xml

- IoC
	- Autofac etc has hard coded registrations for all queries etc
	- Register DbContex
	
- Create way of 'registering' and managing IQuery etc implementations so project can use with IoC containers
	- Create container interface in Reportr core that inherits IContainer (see Autofac for example) and add to ReportrEngine

- Put report categories and "registered" reports (with name, description and definition generator/source (e.g. RDL language or customer class that generates report definition by loading all data sources, queries etc and compiling the components together)) into separate project such as Reportr.Registration
	- With the above, we could have a customer EF version such as Reportr.Registration.Entity that has a custom DbContext with savable entities, so there is no need to code this into the project that uses Reportr
	- This could also contain security such as registered roles and assigning reports to roles and also assigning report parameters to roles with default values


Security
--------

- Reports for certain types of user (roles)

- Locked/defaulted filter parameters/values based on role?


Templates
---------

- How do report template contents tell us their size? How about optional "promised" row height? table header and footer height? Chart height? Then we can calculate page sizes

- Template page optional size (units e.g. %, pixels cm etc) of width and height so we can auto paginate
	- Also add margin details (for printing and screen padding)


Rendering
---------

- Design report auto export mechanism (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON etc)
	- See https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator


Low Priority
------------

- Create 'Infrastructure' project that manages storage and retrieval of categories

- Create report component mocking (e.g. generate fake data for chart) for report building and testing

- Create Report Definition Language (RDL)
	- See docs\Brainstorming\RDL Brainstorm Example.rdl
