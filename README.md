Reportr is a .NET template orientated reporting framework, designed from the ground up as a lightweight solution to solving various reporting problems faced in .NET applications. Typical problems Reportr can be used to solve include:

- Generating complex dashboards
- Generating and exporting system integrated reports
- Creating custom Web APIs to generate queries, statistics or chart data

## Under Construction!
Reportr is currently under development and a working version has not yet been released. I plan to release it on NuGet once version 1.0 is completed. Watch this space!
